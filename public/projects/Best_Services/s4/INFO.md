UI/UX Design System Builder

Description: Internal design system tool: Component library (buttons, forms, modals), theme editor, accessibility checker, export to Figma/code.
Challenge/Solution: Inconsistent branding → Token-based system + Storybook integration ensured 100% consistency.
Metrics: Used by 15+ client teams, reduced design handoff time 50%.
Tech: React + Storybook (components), Tailwind/Shadcn (styling), Chromatic (visual testing), GSAP (component reveal stagger), Three.js (3D component previews).
Visual Hook: Hover morphs components; scroll-triggered color palette shift.
