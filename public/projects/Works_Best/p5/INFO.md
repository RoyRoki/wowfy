Inventory Management System (Intermediate from Dhanian X post)

Description: For e-comm/retail: Stock alerts, barcode scan (mobile), multi-warehouse dashboard, AI demand forecast.
Challenge/Solution: Overstock → ML (TensorFlow.js) forecasts 25% savings; DevOps CI/CD.
Metrics: Managed $2M inventory, 99% accuracy.
Tech: React/Vite (UI), Next.js (API routes), PostgreSQL/Docker (backend), QuaggaJS (barcode), Framer + Three.js (3D warehouse iso).
Visual Hook: Cards stagger with stock level glow (low=red); phone mock scans barcode → animates update.
